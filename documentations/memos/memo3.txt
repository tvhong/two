Language decision:
    C++
    Reason could be we will develop other C++ apps later, this could be a good start
    Goodbye js, we may see you later. Farewell, friend.

Planning:
    Estimate project time:
        ~100 hrs
        8-10 hrs/week, 2 ppl 16-20 hrs/week
        roughly 7 weeks

    Prerequisite:
        Requirement analysis
        Detailed design
        Estimate: 1-1.5 weeks

    Construction:
        might need to add effects
        Estimate: 4 hrs

    Testing/Debugging:
        last 2 weeks

    Color and images:
        Concurrent process
        Probably start 2 weeks before the end,
        at the same time or a bit earlier than testing

    Improving gameplay, user interface:
        We'll do it later, after we finish the game
        Because we need people help
        This will come slowly as we improve the game
