Ability events: 
    onActivated
    onCollisonP
    onCollisonM

Possible solutions:
    Always notify the abilities,
        and let them maintain their 'activationState'
    AbilityManager

Have an enum state in M/P for each Ability
    Deprecated
    Have an AbilityManager is enough

AbilityManager:

    Responsibility: (lol, I can type it)
        Manage input
        Update timing
        Publisher of events, receive events too, of course
        Giving information to graphic

Tmr:
    Walk through some use cases
    Specify interfaces
