Point & Vector class?
  We can also use pair<> or tuple<> or even array
  But that isn't clear enough for the purpose
  So we choose to create Point & Vector classes

We follow Google's C++ style guide
  Cause it's a good reference
  And we're beginners
  We still have a style.txt reference file in case we're lazy

Src folder structure:
  Game/main file in src
  abilities one folder
  world one folder
  screens one folder
  graphics one folder

Ideas:
  PUCK_MIN_SPEED constant
