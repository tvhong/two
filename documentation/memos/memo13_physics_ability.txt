Should Ms have different speed?
  yes, different players might prefer different speeds
  but need to be very careful about balancing.

Current M attributes:
  different speed, size and weight

Physics?
  complicated, but rewarding & overall better
  -> decided to follow physics

Ability
  no negative-buff on opponent's M
  - reason: opponent's A can also have a buff
    and they might overlap, which is annoying

W-AM-A interaction:
  World sends events to AM
  AM call appropriate functions of As
